My custom made flipperzero animations inspired by WD2/DedSec for my upcoming personal custom firmware 


INSTALLATION:

1. Download the Zip file for the animation you want and extract it.

2. Copy the extracted folder to your Flipper's dolphin folder

3. Add the text block for the animation you want to your flippers manifest.txt file located in the dolphin folder

(If you downloaded all zips, you can just copy the content from the manifest.txt file in this repo to and add it to yours)

4. Reboot flipper (either hold LEFT and BACK for 3 Seconds, or go to Settings > Power > Reboot > Flipper OS)

5. Enjoy!
